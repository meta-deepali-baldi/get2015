JSP - Assignments
Session 2
Duration (Number of Hrs)

	 	 	 	

Write a user registration application:
Contains a user registration information form (JSP page) that requests a servlet.
Contains a servlet that accepts the request sent by client and persists the information in the database tables.
Write a login page:
Contains a login jsp page which requires username and password.
The login page requests a servlet to validate the login credentials. The servlet calls the api to fetch the information saved in assignment #1 and then validates it (possibly username and password) against the login credentials.
In case of successful login the jsp page must be displayed showing the successfully logged in and in case of failure the login page 	must again be displayed to re-login.


Note:
In database tables, not all the registration information should be 	persisted. Just persist the username, password and email.
In Assignment #2, you need to make sure all the exceptions must be redirected to error handler jsp page.
